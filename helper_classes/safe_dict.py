SafeDict is a wrapper that uses included python functionality so that dictionaries 
can be frozen and unfrozen to have properties able to be removed, added or changed. 

This is just to replace the readonly attribute from other languages like typescript. 

If a dataclass won't be changed, still handy to use this and set it frozen to be true guarantee no mutation
